```
_Example:_

## 🤔 How Does It Work?

- The client connects directly to a server using just the IP address and port you provide.
- No authentication or credentials required – connection is based solely on network access.
- Ideal for **trusted networks**, rapid troubleshooting, demos, or educational use.

---

## 🛡️ Security Notice

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Anyone with the correct IP and port can connect!  
> Use only on private, secure networks. For public or sensitive use, add extra security (authentication, encryption, etc.).
